# **C â€“ Project Report**

# **Title: Multiple Choice Question Based Quiz**

## **Summary:**

This project is a MCQ based quiz in which there are 15 questions to be answered, by selecting one among the 4 options available.

Each correct answer is awarded four marks (+4) and for each wrong answer, one mark is deducted from the score (-1).

The final score is calculated based on the above, mentioned rules and is displayed at the end of the quiz along with the details about how many questions were answered correctly and how many were wrong, with the serial numbers of the wrong questions being displayed on the screen.

The user may change any answer by going to the previous question or the next question at any given point of time during the quiz. But he/she cannot change the answers once it is submitted and the score board is displayed.

We have used turbo C++ to develop and execute the code. The code is more user friendly and colorful, due to the addition of graphics and sound.

This is the Welcome page of our program for which we have opened a graphic window with the help of the initgraph() function to display the welcome message.

The username of the user is asked which is being stored in a file with the previous users.

The user selects one of the four options which he thinks is the right answer and that answer is highlighted with a green box around it, as in this case it is the option D which the user is selecting and the marks are allotted accordingly.

This is the final scoreboard of our program, where the final score and the details of the answers are being displayed. The serial numbers of the wrongly answered questions are also displayed to inform the user where he has gone wrong. The final score is calculated with the negative marking also taken into account while calculating and it is displayed.
